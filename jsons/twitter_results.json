People quibble about just how realistic ANNs are compared to biological neural networks (they are not, but that's not the point)... There is, however, a more indisputable example and it's the basis for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and modern computer vision.\n\nOne can draw a line between Hubel and Wiesel's Nobel Prize-winning work in the 1960s on vision in cats (and their accidental discovery of an edge-detecting cell in the cat's visual cortex) to AlexNet, which was the first ANN to win the ImageNet competition in 2012!\n\nThe ideas of translational invariance (a vertical edge, for e.g., is a vertical edge regardless of where it is in an image), rotational invariance (an edge is an edge regardless of whether it's vertical or horizontal or somewhere in-between), and the hierarchical combination of simple features to form complex features--all these were first elucidated in neuroscience, and would heavily influence the development of CNNs.\n\nThe influence of neuroscience is one of the narrative arcs in WHY MACHINES LEARN: from the early work of McCulloch and Pitts, who came up with the first model of an artificial neuron, to Frank Rosenblatt's perceptron (a neuron that could learn), Hopfield networks (designed to model associative memories in brains) and modern day CNNs\n\nAll this and so much more is detailed in WHY MACHINES LEARN:\nUS: https://t.co/skiLyCTfmJ\n\nUK: https://t.co/dmHwBbVeGE",

Our biggest constraint on AI is energy: models can be developed in 6 months, data centers can be built in 1-2 years, but new power plants take 5-10 years to come online, and new power transmission infrastructure takes 15-20 years. This is where government can accelerate America's AI dominance. \n\n2. Data infrastructure is tremendously concentrated: 15 states account for 80% of national data center load, with Virginia first among them. Reducing this concentration is both a developmental bottleneck and a national security issue. \n\n3. Federal agencies struggle to recruit staff with AI expertise. Regulators cannot hobble American development of AI ‚Äî but without real tech expertise in government, AI policy risks turning America into another Europe",
